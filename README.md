# Fun Drinks Rails App
The Fun Drinks App is a web application for drink lovers to find and add ingredients and recipes from cocktails to milkshakes. Users can also view drink recipes created with specific ingredients and share their drink recipes with others. Users can search for any ingredient or drink by name. Furthermore, they can browse the latest drinks, drinks, and ingredients filtered by alcohol/alcohol-free on the homepage.

The third-party provider registrations was created with Omniauth, CSS styling with Bootstrap, and data from https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php.
